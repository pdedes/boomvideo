This is a hackathon project @ Fullstack Academy.

Everything about meetings sucks. Fumbling for passcodes, multi-tasking participants, materials haven't been shared early enough, expansion of scope. It's endless.

This project is an experiment with web-video streaming over webRTC built on IceComm.io. The idea is that face-to-face meetings should be launched quickly, and with absolutely minimum overhead.

1. A meeting host visits the site, and launches a meeting room
2. The meeting room name is set
3. The room is now open and ready for guests
4. The host shares a link to guests either via email or phone
5. The guest visits the link and joins the appropriate video channel with the host and other guests
