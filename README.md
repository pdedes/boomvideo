This is a hackathon project @ Fullstack Academy.

Everything about meetings stink. Fumbling for passcodes, multi-tasking participants, the materials haven't been shared early enough, expansion of scope, no one took notes. It's no surprise that we don't like them.

This project is an experiment with web-video streaming over webRTC built on IceComm.io. The idea is that face-to-face meetings should be launched quickly, and with absolutely minimum overhead.

1. A meeting host visits the site, and launches a meeting room
2. The meeting room name is set
3. The room is now open and ready for guests
4. The host shares a link to guests either via email or phone
5. The guest visits the link and joins the appropriate video channel with the host and other guests
